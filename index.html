      <h2 class="c-heading">Why we are starting the Open VoIP Alliance</h2>
      <p>As a part of Devhouse Spindle, a company developing open communication products, we see different open source communities and products working towards the same goal: to have free and open VoIP communication. What we donâ€™t see, however, is a common place for discussions or collaboration on projects that can help the progression of VoIP technology as a whole. To solve this, we are creating the Open VoIP Alliance. Through this alliance, we aim to connect smaller communities and lower the barriers for developing VoIP technologies.</p>
      <h2 class="c-heading">How you can help</h2>
      <p>This alliance is in the beginning stages of formation. We are looking for people that believe in our mission and want to join us from the very beginning to make this alliance a thriving place where VoIP developers and enthusiasts can connect, discuss, and collaborate.</p>
      <div class="c-content">
        <h3 class="c-heading c-heading-small">The mission guiding our efforts</h3>
        <p>Our mission is to boost collaboration within the VoIP space to stimulate advances in the way people communicate. We believe that in an era where cutting edge technology is developed in the open, rather than behind closed doors, working together is more important than ever. Through the combination of our globally distributed efforts, we can evolve the field of voice communications in ways still unimaginable.</p>
        <h3 class="c-heading c-heading-small">Why we believe in free and open software</h3>
        <p>We strive to level the playing field for anyone wanting to get into and evolve the VoIP space, from the farthest corners of the planet to the biggest metropolitan areas. We believe it is essential to lower the barriers-of-entry in order to build a solid foundation for the benefit of voice communication technology as a whole. We aim to do this with the use of <a href="#footnote" class="u-color-secondary">free software *</a>. Free software gives everyone the freedom to use it however they want and share with whomever they like. This freedom has huge benefits. It enables the VoIP community to grow and share its collective experience and expertise to continually improve all things VoIP.</p>

      <p><span class="u-color-secondary">*</span> We adhere to the definition of free software set out by the Free Software Foundation when it talks about 'the four essential freedoms' which are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.</li>
        <li>The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
        <li>The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others.</li>
        <li>The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.</li>
      </ul>
